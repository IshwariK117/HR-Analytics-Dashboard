## Overview
This project focuses on developing an **HR Analytics Dashboard** using Power BI to provide data-driven insights for improving employee performance and reducing attrition rates. The dashboard presents key metrics and visualizations to help organizations make strategic decisions based on workforce data.

## Project Objective
- Develop an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze workforce trends.  
- Enable organizations to **improve employee performance** and **reduce attrition**.  
- Provide actionable insights using KPIs like **employee counts**, **attrition rates**, **average salaries**, and **employee tenure**.  
- Implement filters for **department-wise analysis** to identify high-risk areas.  
- Ensure data accuracy through efficient **data cleaning** and transformation using Power Query.

## Features and Functionalities
### Dashboard Features
- **Department Filters:** Allows users to filter data by departments for targeted insights.  
- **KPIs:** Displays essential metrics like:
  - **Employee Count**
  - **Attrition Rate**
  - **Average Salary**
  - **Employee Tenure**
- **Visual Representations:** Includes bar charts, line graphs, and tables for clear insights and trend identification.  

### Data Analysis Techniques
- Categorized employee data based on demographics (e.g., gender, education) to uncover attrition patterns.  
- Calculated metrics like **average tenure** and **salary distributions** to assess workforce dynamics.  
- Enabled comparison of attrition rates across various employee segments for better decision-making.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Used **Power Query** to:
  - Remove duplicates.  
  - Filter null values.  
  - Correct data types to ensure accurate reporting.  
- Created calculated fields for enhanced data insights.

### Visualization Techniques
- Designed visualizations such as:
  - **Bar Charts** for department-wise analysis.  
  - **Line Graphs** to track attrition trends over time.  
- Customization options like color schemes, labels, and sizes were applied to improve visual clarity.

### Exporting and Sharing
- Provided options to:
  - Export the dashboard as a **PDF** for reporting purposes.  
  - Publish it to **Power BI Service** for wider access by team members and stakeholders.
